ðŸš€ **skript-worldedit** is here! This new Skript addon brings **WorldEdit** and **FAWE** support to Skript, offering numerous effects and expressions for efficient world manipulation.
A shockingly small amount of testing was done, so there may be some bugs lying around. Please report any issues, or new feature requests, on the GitHub. Happy scripting!

### Wiki
For a fairly detailed walkthrough of the syntax and concepts, have a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/cheeezburga/SkWE/wiki)!

### Docs
If you're just looking for a list (with some small explanation) of all the syntax, head on over to [**skript-worldedit**'s SkriptHub docs](http://skripthub.net/docs/?addon=skript-worldedit)

### Features
- Regions - create and use them to run operations
- Patterns and masks - use these exactly like you would in WorldEdit, opening up so many options
- Shapes - create an ellipsoid, cylinder, or pyramid, with a bunch of customizable properties
- Schematics (coming soon...)
